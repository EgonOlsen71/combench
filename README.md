# combench
A test suite for C64 BASIC compilers.

This has been written mainly to test and improve the MOSpeed BASIC compiler: https://github.com/EgonOlsen71/basicv2

It contains the test suite as BASIC V2-sources in the "basic" subdirectory as well as a collection of executable version of it compiled by various C64 BASIC compilers in the "bin" directory.

In the "doc" directory, you can find a document (Libre Office as well as PDF) with the latest results.
